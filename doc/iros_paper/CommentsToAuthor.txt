The paper was reviewed by two expert researchers. They
agreed that the paper presents an interesting and
theoretically correct thing. On the other hand, they also
had the same impression that it is questionable how it
works in practice. The associate editor thinks that it is
not mandatory to show it, but it will definitely improve
the relevance of the paper if the authors suggest some real
applications.
