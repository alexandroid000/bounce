Comments to the author
======================

This paper deals with periodic navigation of mobile robots
in polygonal environment. The authors analyse the behavior
of a point robot moving inside regular polygonal
environments. The robot moves in straight line. Each time
the robot runs into a wall, it bounces on the wall with a
constant given angle (theta).

The authors establish some properties on the formerly
defined bouncing angle, such that trajectories of the robot
converge to orbit trajectories. Two main cases are
considered. First the robot bounces from one edge to an
adjacent edge. Second, the robot bounces skipping $m-1$
edges. In both cases, the authors provide some conditions
on theta so that the robot converges to orbit trajectories.

The paper is well written, the reasoning, based on
trigonometrics, is elegant. In Section V.A, the authors
discuss the results in terms of robustness. The
developments leading to the main results of the paper
provide some bounds on the acceptable error of the bouncing
angle. Apart from this Section however, the paper is rather
theoretical and far from any application. Let us remark
that without operational constraint that forces the robot
to move "inside" the polygon, taking theta = pi/2 yields
the most robust behavior since the robot simply endlessly
follows the walls.

As a conclusion, the paper is interesting and well written,
but rather far from any reasonable application.

Following are some minor comments.
page 3, top of the page: "the period of this orbit is k+1".
I would write "k" instead.
Lemma 1: $\phi$ is used just before being defined.
Lemma 2: a closing parenthesis is missing.
Proof of Lemma 3: $\c(\theta)$ is implicitly redefined with
another expression.
