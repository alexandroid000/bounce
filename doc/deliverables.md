Deliverables / Goals for Spring 18 Semester

To Prove
--------
- how many orbits exist in a polygon with n sides and k reflex angles?
    - how many which are convex polygons "embedded" in the nonconvex polygon?
    - how many others?
- in polygons with orbits that are identical up to symmetry, what initial
  conditions lead to which orbit?
- what is the information space for a bouncing robot?
    - with one laser beam in the environment?
    - with k laser beams?
    - with uniquely identifiable walls?
    - with walls colored one of k colors?
- Non-contraction mappings composed with contraction mappings can produce a
  contraction mapping. Must be at least one contraction mapping and must be
  "as big as" all the expanding maps. There are geometrical constraints on periodic orbits
  (robots rotation must be 2pi*winding number). So for any given sequence of
  edges, we can create composition and check for contraction. Are there clever
  ways we can search through edge sequences? Maximally contracting orbits?

Storing Random Writings Here
----------------------------

Just as there is work about planning with robots with kinodynamic constraints,
"bouncing" is a special type of kinodynamic constraint. But instead of planning
over all possible movement sequences, we plan over *robust* movement sequences:
movement patterns that reduce uncertainty in the robots state. This can also be
seen as a form of calibration-through-actuation.
